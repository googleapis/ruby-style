## Supported Ruby Versions

These libraries are currently supported on Ruby 2.4+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
by Ruby Coreâ€”that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or
in security maintenance, and not end of life. Currently, this means Ruby 2.4
and later. Starting with Ruby 2.4, minor releases of the google-style gem under
`1.x.x` will correspond with the required Ruby version, with `1.24.x` requiring
Ruby 2.4.
See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details about the Ruby support schedule.
